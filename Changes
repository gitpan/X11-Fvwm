Revision history for Perl extension X11::Fvwm.

0.1  Thu Feb 13 19:37:35 1997
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18

	Released as alpha 1 on Wed Mar 19

0.2  Fri Mar 28 18:14:55 MST 1997
        - intended to be alpha 2

* Changed the invocation of handlers to include a reference to the X11::Fvwm
  object as the first parameter. Otherwise, handlers have no access to the
  object unless the object is global or the handler is created as a closure.

* Removed the Tk references in Fvwm.pm, so that X11::Fvwm acts as a base
  class for the API. Fvwm/Tk.pm (X11::Fvwm::Tk) now is a subclass of X11::Fvwm
  with the new() and eventLoop() methods overloaded. Also adds one new
  instance variable and a method to access it by. This should simplify adding
  other GUI widget sets, such as Xforms.

* Put in some simple default handlers in Fvwm/Defaults.pm (package
  X11::Fvwm::Defaults), that can be used if they meet the developer's needs.
  So far, only M_ERROR seems to lend itself to such a default handling.

* X11::Fvwm, X11::Fvwm::Tk, X11::Fvwm::Defaults and PerlTkWL are all -w and -T
  clean.

* Makefile.PL now handles the demos as *.PL files, which allows them to be
  extracted by perl itself, which results in an invocation line based on
  the user's configuration of perl.  Also checks for a usable version of
  the Tk extension.

0.3  Wed Apr 30 13:41:51 MDT 1997
	- first beta release

* Only major change: The use of asterisk (*) to specify directives to the
  getConfigInfo method has been deprecated in favor of the dash (-). You will
  currently be warned when getConfigInfo encounters the old style, but the
  first official release (whenever I reach a stable 1.0) will remove this
  entirely.

* Tentative support of X11::Xforms (version 0.7 or later) added.

* More demo scripts added.

* Some minor cleanup here and there. Little of this, as 0.2 was pretty stable.

* All *.pm have documentation (though some demos still need it).
