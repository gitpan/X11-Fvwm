Version 1.0 of X11::Fvwm has been uploaded to PAUSE, and should propagate to
CPAN servers over the next few days.

This is the first regular release. The basic functionality of the API and
the constants is now pretty well frozen. Only changes to Fvwm2 should have
any future impact. More may be added, but what is currently implemented will
be supported.

The biggest changes from previous releases are that it now requires that you
have Perl 5.003 or later, and that your version of Fvwm is 2.0.46 or later.
It also now checks your version of Fvwm from the source base, to verify this.

From the README file for 1.0:

X11::Fvwm version 1.0 (altus)

WHAT IS IT?

This is a Perl 5 extension to simplify writing Fvwm2 modules in Perl 5. Not
only in Perl 5, but with either the Tk extension or the Xforms library as
your GUI choices!

This requires fvwm 2.0.46 or better, and Perl 5.003 or better. It is
very highly recommended that you also install the latest version of Tk
or X11::Xforms, also available from CPAN.

WHAT DOES IT DO?

Fvwm2 has a very well-defined module API, to allow the brunt of non-core
window-manager work be done by external modules. X11::Fvwm is a layer over
this interface, allowing you to use Perl rather than C as the language for
developing these modules.

When fvwm launches a module, it sets up file descriptors for two-way
communication, and proceeds to occassionally broadcast data packets to
those modules that have asked to receive the given data type. The modules,
in turn, can send commands back to fvwm, including requests for more (and
more specific) data, operation on windows managed by fvwm, etc.

PROBLEMS/BUG REPORTS

Please send any reports of problems or bugs to randy@byz.org. I wouldn't
mind a short note to know that you're using this, just so I can justify its
continued development :-).

From the Changes file for 1.0:

* Added a new sample Tk script, PerlTkDesker

* A little more documentation clean-up.

* Dropped the shipping of two patches that are now part of Fvwm 2.0.46

* Makefile.PL now allows for specification of FVWM_DIR (for source) and
  FVWM_MOD_DIR (for installation of samples). It also checks for a file
  version.h in $FVWM_DIR, and checks that it defines VERSION, and that
  VERSION is at least the required level.
