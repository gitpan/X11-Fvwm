This patch provides the ColorLimit functionality that X11::Fvwm also supports.
This patch will work against 2.0.46 Fvwm, though you may have to use the
apropos options to patch to overlook whitespace discrepancies. The GNU patch
command line you'll need is:

patch --ignore-whitespace --fuzz=3

The patches previously distributed (to alter the format of the windowshade
and mini-icon packet types) are no longer needed, as they were rolled in to
2.0.46. It is recommended that you be using *.46, since the X11::Fvwm unpack
formats for these packets expects them to be the updated form. If you are
using an older Fvwm2 for some reason, you can download the last version of
this package (0.4) for those patches.
