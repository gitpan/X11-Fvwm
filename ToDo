* Three packet types are still undocumented, and thus not really supported.
  In addition, two (M_ICON_FILE and M_DEFAULTICON) I was just guessing at
  to begin with.

* Need more example scripts. Maybe even a separate document that better
  explains the Fine Art of writing packet handlers. Or even a better
  document on the module API. But then we get into stuff that needs to be
  with Fvwm itself.

* Get delivery of scripts into a configurable module path, currently go to
  /usr/local/lib/X11/fvwm2.
